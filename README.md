# Note Directory Generator

Simple command line script that creates md file templates for my classes. The code is not elegant at all as this is more for my personal use and this was my first project in Rust.


## Running 

To run, simply clone the script (assuming Rust is installed on your system)
```
$ cargo run
```

```
Enter 'Semester: Course1, Course2, Course3'
ex_semester: course1, course2, course3
```

## Example Output
```
$ cd ex_semester
```
```
$ ls
course1.md     course2.md     course3.md
```
